# Stereo-Computer-Vision-3D-Reconstruction

This assignment will exercise the concepts of two-view stereo and photometric stereo. 

The project contains three parts. 

1) Photometric Stereo Given a stack of images taken from the same viewpoint under different, known illumination directions, your task is to recover the albedo and normals of the object surface.

2) Plane sweep Stereo Given two calibrated images of the same scene, but taken from different viewpoints, your task is to recover a rough depth map.

3) Depth map reconstruction Given a normal map, depth map, or both, reconstruct a 3D mesh.
